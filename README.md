This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract data from websites using Selenium, a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through the program. It's built in Python 


## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up this project:

1. Clone the repository

   You can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   2. Set up a virtual environment (optional)

   It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of this project. 

   - On Linux:

     You can do this by running:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     You can do this by running:

     ```bash
     py -m venv env
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   This will create a new virtual environment in a folder named `env` and activate it. While the virtual environment is activated, any packages you install with pip will be installed in the virtual environment, not globally.

   3. Install the dependencies

   After setting up and activating the virtual environment, you can install the required Python packages with pip by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   4. Download the WebDriver

   Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser.

   5. Run the project

   After installing the dependencies and setting up the WebDriver, you can now run the project. Navigate to the directory containing your project's Python script in the terminal. Then, run the script with the Python command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
This project requires the following Python packages:

   i. selenium
   
   ii. pandas
